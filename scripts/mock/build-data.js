/* Mock build-data.js for the smoke test — a CONFORMING build.
   Deliberately mirrors what a good build ships: five hero stats, a locked intro
   beat, sample-not-census narration, raw scores (the template rescales them),
   and no banned phrases. The smoke test asserts against this, so when a copy
   rule changes here it must change in build-data-template.js too. */
