   build-data-template.js — schema for the FDI scroll cinematic (build.html)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
   build.html is 100% generic; this file is the ONLY founder-specific input.
   Copy to the build repo as `build-data.js` and fill every key from the
   build's own REAL artifacts — never invent numbers, quotes, or sources.

   Generation sources per key:
     - config.json          -> founder block, geo, excluded competitors
     - CONTEXT.md           -> narration voice, market stats, wow reasoning
     - webset-spec.json     -> process stages, axes, scan query, enrichments
     - scored companies     -> companies[], evidenceFeed, partners
       (webset-response.json / data.js / phase7-scored equivalents)

   COPY RULES for every narration string (validated in Phase 10):
     - Voice: confident analyst briefing the founder. No vendor pitch.
     - Hyphens only. NEVER em dashes.
     - A SAMPLE, NEVER A CENSUS. What ships is a first-pass sample of the
       strongest ICP fits our process surfaced, shown to the founder to sharpen
       the filtering and the signals. It is not the market and not a finished
       target list. Banned outright: "most ready to buy", "the readiest buyers",
       "the [N] accounts to target", "we scan the entire market", "accounts worth
       walking into", and any market-wide superlative. Scope rankings to
       "relative readiness within this sample". (Jason, 8/17.)
     - Numbers that came from the FOUNDER get attributed ("your own sizing"), and
       every count reads as an artifact of the process, never as the size of the
       opportunity. [X] profiled and [Y] curated are different numbers - never
       conflate them.
     - Three rendered lines maximum per beat, and no line may wrap onto a single
       orphan word. Measure it: `npm run smoke` in the template repo renders both
       pages and fails on either.
     - Honest hedges stay ("illustrative", "where we have one").
     - Apostrophes inside JS strings must be curly (’), never straight quotes
       that terminate the string.
